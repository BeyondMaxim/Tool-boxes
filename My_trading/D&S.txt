Development of a Professional Trading Tool for Mexc Futures


We are seeking a skilled freelancer to develop an alternative solution to our current trading tool. Our existing setup involves a Windows VPS running simple macros to execute buy and sell orders for futures on the Mexc exchange, based on signals received from a TradingView webhook strategy. This current system, while functional, lacks professionalism and is prone to errors and delays.

Objectives:

- Improve Reliability and Efficiency: The new solution must significantly reduce the risk of errors and minimize the delay between signal receipt and order execution. Speed and reliability are our top priorities.

- Enhance Functionality: The tool should support simultaneous trading of multiple coins, expanding our trading capabilities beyond the current limitations.

- Implement Logging and Reporting: It must include a logging feature that collects all order data. Additionally, this data should be automatically shared to a Discord or Telegram channel to ensure transparency and real-time monitoring of trading activities.

- Revenue Calculation: Another crucial feature is the automatic calculation of total revenue generated daily, weekly, and monthly. This will help in assessing the tool's performance over different time frames.

Challenges:
- Mexc does not offer an API for futures trading, necessitating a creative approach to interact with the exchange's system efficiently and reliably.
- Ensuring minimal latency in signal processing and order execution to maximize trading opportunities.

Requirements:
- Experience in developing trading tools or bots, especially those that interface with exchanges through unconventional methods (e.g., without direct API support for specific functionalities).
- Strong programming skills, with proficiency in creating efficient, low-latency systems.
- Familiarity with integrating webhooks and automating interactions with websites.
- Ability to implement comprehensive logging and reporting features, including integration with Discord or Telegram for real-time updates.
- Proven track record of developing secure, reliable software solutions.

Project Deliverables:
- A fully functional trading tool that meets the described objectives and requirements.
- Documentation detailing the tool's setup, operation, and any maintenance requirements.
- Source code for the tool, with appropriate comments for maintainability.

Interested candidates should provide a portfolio of similar projects they have worked on, including any relevant experiences with trading systems, bots, or automation tools that operate in a limited API environment. Please also include a brief proposal outlining your approach to developing the solution, including any technologies or strategies you plan to employ to overcome the challenges described.

This project offers an opportunity to work on a unique challenge at the intersection of finance and technology. We look forward to your innovative solutions to enhance our trading operations on the Mexc exchange.

Question1 : 
please explain about  Windows VPS running simple macros to execute buy and sell orders for futures on the Mexc exchange, based on signals received from a TradingView webhook strategy in details..

Answer:
To set up a Windows VPS to run simple macros for executing buy and sell orders for futures on the Mexc exchange based on signals from a TradingView webhook strategy, you can follow these detailed steps:

1. Windows VPS Setup:
   - Ensure you have a compatible Windows VPS, such as Windows 10 or 11, Windows Server 2016, 2019, or 2022[5].
   - Download and install the necessary software for running macros and executing trades on the Mexc exchange.

2. TradingView Webhook Strategy:
   - Create a TradingView webhook strategy that generates signals for buy and sell orders based on your trading criteria.
   - Set up the webhook alerts in TradingView to trigger when specific conditions are met[4].

3. Macro Creation:
   - Develop simple macros using tools like AutoHotkey or other automation software to interact with the Mexc exchange platform.
   - Write scripts that can receive signals from the TradingView webhook and execute corresponding buy or sell orders on the Mexc exchange.

4. Integration:
   - Integrate the TradingView webhook alerts with your macro scripts running on the Windows VPS.
   - Ensure that the macros are programmed to interpret the signals correctly and execute trades accurately based on the received alerts.

5. Testing and Monitoring:
   - Test the entire setup thoroughly in a simulated environment to ensure that buy and sell orders are executed correctly.
   - Monitor the performance of your macros and adjust them as needed to optimize their efficiency and accuracy.

By following these steps, you can create a system where your Windows VPS runs macros to execute buy and sell orders for futures on the Mexc exchange based on signals received from your TradingView webhook strategy.
